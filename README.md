Assignment 1 for OSU Bootcamp

This is assignment 1 for Ohio State Universities Coding Bootcamp. The objective of this assignment was to refractor given code to make it more accessible without changing the functionality of the web page. This was done mainly by using semantic HTML, which, in doing so allowed me to consolidate a lot of the CSS code. The final product needed to render like the image below:

This project was built to accomplish several things:

-Intorduce me to HTML.

-Introduce me to CSS.

-Learn about semantic HTML and how to incorporate it properly.

-Learn about accessiblity. 

-Put into practice the things learned by making an exisiting webpage more accessible. 

Ultimately, I learned the importance of semantic HTML. How clean, concise, code can make a big difference for individuals having to use screen readers. This was a fun assignment that went beyond just learning proper HTML/CSS syntax and properties.
